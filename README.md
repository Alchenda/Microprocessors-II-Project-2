# Microprocessors-II-Project-2
This lab incorporates the use of the Arduino to control a snake game written in python.
Both the arduino and the python script must be ran at the same time in order for this lab to function properly. The snake game should be ran first, then followed by the arduino to ensure proper serial communication is established.
The snake program is written in Python.
The Arduino script is written in C.
